/*What is JS */
//JS is a high-level, object-oriented, multi-paradigm programming language.
//High level means there are lot of abstractions, we don't need to worry about how memory & cache is been utilized
//and how data is been extracted/modified.
//Object-oriented because JS is based on objects for storing most kinds of data.
//Multi-paradigm as it's very flexible and varsatile. We could use different styles of programming such as imperative/declarative.
//Styles means different ways of structuring our codes basically.

/*Core Technologies of Web*/
//There may be a question what JS does. And to answer that question, let's actually look at a three core technologies of the web.
//They are HTML, CSS and of course, JavaScript.
//So these three technologies all work together to create beautiful, interactive and dynamic websites or web applications.
//Now the HTML is responsible for the content of the page.
//So the text, the images, the buttons, and all the contents that you see on the webpage is always written in HTML.
//Then the CSS is responsible for the presentation of that content. So basically for styling and for laying out the elements on a webpage.
//And then, JavaScript is the real programming language of the internet. It allows developers to add dynamic & interactive effects
//to any webpage. We also use it to manipulate the content or the CSS, load data from remote servers and build entire applications
//in the browser, which we then call web applications.
//ES stands for ECMA Script. ECMA International standardizes JS programming language.

//Everyting in JS is either an object or a primitive.
//data types.
//So there are seven primitive data types:
//number, string, boolean, undefined, null, symbol (ES2015) and bigint (ES2020).
//We can change the type of a variable easily.
//I need to point out that we actually don't even have to declare variables at all.
//We can just write some variable and assign a value to it.
